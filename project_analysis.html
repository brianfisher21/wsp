			<h2>Site Analysis:</h2>
			
				<p>	
					This project is a renovation to the website of Big State Drugs, an original 1950's drug store and dinner. Big State is a staple business
					in the city of Irving, Texas, servicing its community since the 1950's. With that said, the goals for this redesign will be to capture the nostalgic,
					family oriented and friendly feel you get when stepping inside the physical brick and mortar of Big State Drugs. First, I plan to capture this 
					feeling and convey it through their website by using a vintage color scheme combined with images that give a sense of "down home" and a simplistic structure to
					keep the site user-friendly. Second, I will update the coding to HTML5 and CSS3 to allow for cross-browser compatibilities to reach a greater audience across 
					virtually all platforms. In the long run these changes will allow Big State Drugs to better connect with its loyal customers, will 
					drive new business and will allow the clients to the easily modify the sites aesthetics and content self-sufficiently if they choose to.

			<h2>Competitive Analysis:</h2>
			
				<p> From my research I have found that there are other original drug store and soda fountain businesses within Texas but they either do not have a working website or they 
					do not directly resemble the Big State's business plan. The only real threat to this business is the modernized pharmacy and fast food chains because their technological
					advances and ease of use.<br>
					
					Big State Drugs is in a league of their own. Their business thrives upon those that want to reminisce and introduce the younger years to a piece of the 
					"good ole days". The runs off of those that have had a relationship with the business for years and those that neglect change.
					
				
			
			<h2>Competitors Sites:</h2>
			
				<div id="sites">
					
					<ul>
						<li><a href="http://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/"><strong>Walgreens Pharmacy</strong></a></li>
							<p class="discription"> The website for Walgreens Pharmacy is very clean and organized. It is very easy to navigate because if its simplistic design. I also enjoy 
								all the helpful information throughout the site.
							</p>
						
						<li><a href="http://www.walmart.com/cp/pharmacy/5431"><strong>Wal-mart Pharmacy</strong></a></li>
							<p class="discription"> Wal-mart's site is a great website but to me it is too cluttered and is overwhelming on the eye. I do really like the My Cart options and the drop down menu to Find a Store. 
								Also, once you find it the Manage My Prescriptions is quite accommodating. 
							</p>
								
						<li><a href="http://www.watsonsdrugs.com/index.php?p=page&page_id=Delivery/"><strong>Watsons Drug and Soda Fountain</strong></a></li>
							<p class="discription"> This website was the best I could find for an actual drug and fountain store. This still is a dated site but yet depicts a story of a time lost through its imagery.
							</p>
					</ul>

					<p> 
						This site will convey that Big State Drugs is about family and community. It will appeal to audiences of 
						all ages by helping those that are elderly with renewing their prescriptions without having to leave the comfort of their home, update the community of events and daily specials and also utilize social media as 
						well to target the younger generations resulting in new business and new memories that may spark a new loyal customer to this time capsule of a business. I want the target audience to 
						feel at home while on the site so it will be organized and simple for those that are not tech savvy.
